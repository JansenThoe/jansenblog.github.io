                    <h4>Boyolali's Decreasing Rice Fields</h4>
                    <h6>18/02/2024</h6>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recently, the Solo-Jogja toll road in Indonesia, Jawa Tengah, was built and is now operational. The toll road passes through some parts of Boyolali, a nearby city of Solo. Boyolali has lots of rice fields, and building toll roads would require stacking different types and sizes of rocks on the fields. According to detik.com on 28 November of 2022, a total of 95 hectares of rice fields were affected by the toll road. Since many people in Boyolali are farmers, many people’s income will decrease.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To combat it, we can increase crop productivity, which is the quantitative measure of crop yield in a given measure area of a field. We can do this by using better equipment like tractors, etc. Protecting the fields from pests and improving the irrigation system are some more ways to increase productivity, but there are still a lot more.</p>

                    <h4>Solutions To Improve Field Productivity</h4>
                    <h6>26/02/2024</h6>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Boyolali, rice fields have become the only source of income for many people. Unfortunately, with the building of the Solo-Jogja toll road, a total of 95 hectares of rice fields were replaced with roads. Although the government gave money to the farmers affected, many farmers who don’t invest the money in a new field and instead buy consumer products–like food, cleaning products, etc.–will get a decreased amount of income in the long run.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, the farmers must increase the productivity of their rice field. There are potentially some solutions involving technology. An example is using ICTs to help small-holder farmers and family farmers. With ICTs, a simple SMS message can alert the farmers about important information–like weather, etc. For example, if a farmer has access to weather reports, and knows it’s going to rain in the evening, then there won’t be any need to irrigate the field.</p>

                    <h4>How Boyolali Deals With Expensive Farming Equipment</h4>
                    <h6>26/02/2024</h6>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In modern farming, big tractors and special pieces of equipment are used. This could be a problem, though, especially for farmers in Boyolali. This is because the tractors and other equipment are very expensive. So, Boyolali farmers are only able to buy hand tractors, but some don’t even have one.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To help these farmers out, the Ministry of Finance of Indonesia gave away around 100 tractors annually. Just last year, Boyolali gave away Rp1,182,510,800, or around $75,000 worth of farming equipment. The types of equipment include 22 cultivators, 70 electric hand sprayers, 5 three-wheeled vehicles, 20 two-wheeled tractors, and 3 water pumps (according to Pemerintah Kabupaten Boyolali). The people hope that with the help of farming equipment, the productivity of the farmers and the lands will increase.</p>
